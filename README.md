## Classification

> I tried to use some of the topics of oop and gui
> This project is a simple library system implemented in Java, consisting of
several classes:

[Library-Management-System Code](https://github.com/Ahmedhany-1/Library-Management-System-lab).
1. Book: Represents a book with attributes such as ID, name, total quantity,
   and total borrowed copies. It provides methods for borrowing and returning
   copies.


2. User: Represents a library user with attributes like name, ID, and an array to
   store borrowed book IDs. It provides methods for borrowing and returning
   books.


3. LibrarySystem: Manages the library's books and users. It allows adding
   books and users, printing library books sorted by ID or name, printing
   users, borrowing books by users, returning books, and printing who
   borrowed a specific book.


4. LibrarySystemGUI: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting
   with the library system. Users can add books and users, search for books,
   borrow and return books, and view various library information.
   The GUI includes buttons for performing different actions and an output text
   area to display results and messages. It offers functionalities like adding
   books/users, printing library details, borrowing/returning books, searching for
   books, and displaying who borrowed a specific book.
